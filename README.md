## 3. Best Practices for Mr. Oyesile

### Personal Digital Safety
- *Use strong, unique passwords*. Example: SecureRubycom!2025  
- *Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)* on email, banking apps, social media.  
- *Use a Password Manager* (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password).  
- *Avoid public Wi-Fi*. If necessary, use a trusted VPN (e.g., ProtonVPN, NordVPN).  
- *Keep your primary phone updated* — OS and all apps.  

### Secure Communication
- *WhatsApp:* Turn on 2FA. Lock app with fingerprint.  
- *Use Signal for confidential chats.*  
- Avoid sharing sensitive info via SMS or unsecured email.

### Social Media Protection
- Restrict who can see your profile and posts.  
- Do not post live travel locations.  
- Review friend/follower lists periodically.  
- Monitor for impersonation or cloned accounts.

## 4. Device & Account Hygiene

- Regularly check your Google/Microsoft account logins.  
- Use biometrics + PIN on all devices.  
- Don’t allow unknown USB drives or devices on work laptops.  
- Set device auto-lock to 30 seconds.  
- Backup important data weekly (offline or encrypted cloud).

---

## 5. Business Operations Security

### For Internal Teams
- Brief senior staff on phishing and BEC scams.  
- Enforce basic security for devices (antivirus, updates).  
- Review access rights — staff shouldn’t have more access than needed.  
- Create a simple offboarding process: revoke email, remove shared drive access.

### For Vendors
- Prefer vendors that follow good IT practices.  
- Request digital copies of security certificates or insurance (if relevant).  
- Avoid sharing admin access with external vendors.

## 6. Travel Security Advisory

### Pre-Travel
- Notify only trusted aides about travel plans.  
- Don’t post travel locations online.  
- Install updates before traveling.  
- Take a secondary device for sensitive business, if possible.

### During Travel
- Avoid business activities on hotel/public Wi-Fi.  
- Use a travel-specific email for bookings/logins.  
- Turn off Bluetooth/NFC when not in use.  
- Be cautious of shoulder surfing, unsolicited USB drives, fake Wi-Fi networks.

### Post-Travel
- Review device activity logs.  
- Change passwords used during the trip.  
- Report any suspicious activity observed.

## 7. Nigerian Cyber Threat Landscape (2025 Insight)

- *BEC and phishing dominate* — especially against executives and finance teams.  
- *SIM swap fraud and account impersonation* are rising.  
- *Insider fraud* is increasing with disgruntled or careless employees.  
- *Cybercrime-as-a-service* is cheap and accessible via Telegram and darknet markets.  
- *Attackers now use WhatsApp, Instagram, and SMS as entry points*, not just email.

---

## 8. Smart Habits for Executives

- Trust no link. Always verify.  
- Confirm payment instructions via phone — never rely on email alone.  
- Assume anything public can be used against you.  
- Build a culture of awareness among your inner circle and PA.  
- Use tech intentionally — security is more about behavior than tools.

---

## 9. Recommendations

- Quarterly cybersecurity check-ins (15 mins).  
- Schedule a short awareness briefing for top aides or team leads.  
- Consider a digital risk audit for Rubycom's main systems.  
- Stay updated on local threat trends via NITDA, CBN advisories, or trusted analysts.

## 10. Closing

Cybersecurity for high-profile leaders is no longer optional. A few smart changes can block the most common attacks. You don’t need to be technical — just aware, alert, and consistent.
